## The Division Men CMS
----

This app started as a website redesign and turned into creating a content management system for the band's website built with Ruby on Rails.  The users are able to add, edit, and control content including blog posts, tour dates, and adding embedded music and video players through adding URLs to the PostgreSQL database.
