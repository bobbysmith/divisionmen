      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>TThis Texas bred, Husband / Wife, Acoustic Duo originally formed in Berlin, Germany in 2008. They are now based in Austin, TX. The band is made up of founder J. Spencer Portillo (vocals / acoustic guitar) and Caroline Rippy Portillo (vocals / bass guitar).</p>

      <p>The Division Men's name was derived from the idea of artists collaborating from all over the world despite their locations. Originally formed in Berlin in 2008, the duo wrote and recorded and eventually returned to Texas.</p>

      <p>Caroline was born in San Antonio, Texas. From 2007 until 2012, she played bass guitar for Tito & Tarantula. J. Spencer Portillo was born in Los Angeles, California but was raised in El Paso, Texas. His El Paso roots offer a huge influence on the lyrics which frequently present atmospheric portraits of love, life and death in a border town.</p>

      <p>The Division Men are actively touring and promoting their latest album "Ni√±os Del Sol " which was recorded at their in-home studio in Austin, Texas. The Division Men have a distinctive sound that has been described as dark, romantic, ethereal, and haunting. The album features Rafael Gayol (Leonard Cohen), Steven Hufsteter (The Quick | Tito and Tarantula | Del Shannon), Jay Reynolds (Asleep at the Wheel), Javier Escovedo (The Zeros | True Believers) , Mitch Hertz (Bloody Kids), Raiye Rippy and Jake Garcia (The Black Angels).</p>
